      <h2>Integrity</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I believe in being honest and transparent in all my actions, personally and professionally.</li>
        <li>Growing up, my family valued being honest and doing the right thing even when no one is looking.</li>
        <li>It's important to me to have integrity because I would want the same value in people close to me. I want to deal with honest people.</li>
        <li>If people cannot trust you to do the right thing, then you may lose friends, opportunities, and develop a bad reputation that may follow you the rest of your life.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Continuous Learning</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I strive to grow through curiosity, learning new skills, and staying open to feedback.</li>
        <li>Once I got into education, I quickly learned that things change, and if I was going to stay relevant in my field, I had to evolve and continue to learn new things.</li>
        <li>It's important to have this mindset because things are constantly changing. To be considered for future opportunities, you must stay up to date with your industry knowledge and skills.</li>
        <li>If people cannot trust you to do the right thing, then you may lose friends, opportunities, and develop a bad reputation that may follow you the rest of your life.</li>

      <h2>Respect</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I value diversity of thought and treat everyone with dignity and respect.</p>
        <li>My family valued treating others with respect no matter their status in life. The golden rule was something we lived by in our household. </li>
        <li>It's important to respect others because if you show them respect, you tend to be respected back.  Integrity and respect go together.  Its hard to respect someone with no integrity</li>
        <li>If you don't show others respect, you may not be respected back.  This goes a long way when you work with others.  If people don't respect you, then the relationship you have with them will suffer.</li>  
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Responsibility</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I take ownership of my actions and am committed to ethical decision-making.</li>
        <li>Taking responsibility was also very important in my family.  We had responsibilities that needed to be completed, but we also held each other accountable for our actions.</li>
        <li>Your choices in life create the person you become.  Everyone makes mistakes but we should learn from them and hold ourselves and others accountable for lessons we don't learn.</li>
        <li>I believe if our society doesn't hold be accountable for their actions, then people will think they can do whatever they please, good or bad, and this could lead to the demise of our society.</li>
